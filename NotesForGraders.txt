What I focused

- High-Level Requirements
- Basic Functionalities
- Edge Cases and bugs
- Component Structure
- State Data Structure


What I would improve if I have more time

- Styling (improve basic styling and responsiveness)
- Edge cases such as schedule collision


Additional Notes:

- The instruction was alittle confusing to me and I have implemented feature so that they can add schedule under the conditions provided
- It was definitely a fun Project and Thank you.
